# Travel-App :earth_africa:

Last project for **Udacity** course.<br>
This project, made us combine all the skills learned and developped during the course. 
The requirements for this work, included: 
Creating requests to 3 different API`s (**Geonames**; **Weatherbit** and **Pixabay** ). We only needed the client to give us 2 values, **City** and **Data** and then we would get the rest of the values required to communicate with the API.

## To run the app.
You will need to Clone or Fork the project, then `cd` into your folder and run "npm install".
The dependencies are:
 "@babel/polyfill": "^7.12.1",
 "axios": "^0.20.0",
 "body-parser": "^1.19.0",
 "bulma": "^0.9.1",
 "cors": "^2.8.5",
 "express": "^4.17.1",
 "supertest": "^6.0.0",
 "webpack": "^5.1.3",
 "webpack-cli": "^4.1.0"

 After installing all the packages and dependencies, you will need to create an account on the 3 APIÂ´s.  
 The scripts to run the app:

 "test" -- To run jest tests on the app.
 "start" -- to start the server.
 "build-prod" -- to start the app in a production environment. 
 "build-dev" -- to start the app in a development environment.

#### App in the browser
This app is currently running on port 4500, so after starting the server and choosing the environment (production / development), you can put this (http://localhost:4500/) on your browser and check the app working.
